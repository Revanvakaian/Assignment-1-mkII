<h3> Ideal Job-</h3> 
<p>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52524609?type=standard#searchRequestToken=be9bb44e-5d09-4344-9e2b-005a8a1743b6target="_blank">Business Analyst: Cyber Security</a>
<br>  
The position that I would find to be the ideal job would be is a business analyst working on projects within the cybersecurity space.
<p>
The position advertised by FinXL IT Professional Services carries with it many duties and responsibilities to accomplish its role such as creating and documenting program work while also bearing in mind many constraints that may be in place, such as: budget, timeline, support etc. Also being adept at translating consumer needs and requirements is an important duty in order to be able to communicate successfully with customers. The part that appeals the most to me within this job is taking what the customers wants and interpreting it into a reality, in essence the customer passes on what they want to myself and then I spend the time to turn that into a real service or product for them.
<p>

The requirements of relevant skills and qualifications for this job are largely based around previous IT experience particularly with reference to working within a large company like FinXL is themselves. Previous experience in a role as a business analyst or within a telecommunications company in any capacity will also lend credence to any application put forward.
<p>
Currently my own experience and skills with IT is limited to my current job as a manager at EB Games and the previous applications I employed while studying at Deakin university, those of which are relatively easy to find amongst a majority of job candidates. Examples include: beginner to intermediate skills in word and excel.
<p>
Hopefully from participating and completing this course An Introduction to I.T it can allow my knowledge to grow enough that I can gain employment, while maybe not in this particular role as a business analyst but in the field of IT in general. I am aware I learn and grow much better in practical environments so I feel the best and fastest way for me to gain the relevant business analyst skills is exposure to the constraints and requirements of a real position. This will lead to myself gathering the requirements for this position, the more hands on experience I can gain the more knowledge that will allow me to grow.
