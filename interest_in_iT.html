<h3> Interest in IT-</h3> 
<p>
I have always been fascinated by I.T from a young age, like innumerable people I’m sure it began as interest in gaming. From there my interest in IT has stemmed to a machine making life simpler and easier by us -as users- telling them what to do. Growing up a lot of my family came to me for I.T trouble and issues out of necessity to understand their problems I found myself inadvertently learning a great many things about the use of computers and the like. A person that probably had the most impact on my interest in IT was my primary school year 6 teacher who was the head of IT for our school, which at the time only contained a total of 12 computers. 
<p>
I chose to come to RMIT to study for I.T after failing to find the job satisfaction I didn’t realise I needed which I wasn’t getting from my current field at the time of environmental science. Taking some time to revaluate what I felt I needed and wanted from my future career I realised that I still very much enjoyed the world of IT and it still held a fascination to me even now. Speaking to several friends about their experience in IT I decided to enrol in this course Introduction to Information Technology in order to get a basic coverage and understanding of the fundamentals of IT. scrolling through Open Universities Australia I found this course and the rest as they say is history.
<p>
I’m hoping from this course I can be shown and understand the fundamentals of IT to give me an overview of the broad subject then, ideally, I can pursue a career down my favourite road within I.T. I am personally most keen to get into the subjects of cybersecurity, AI and robotics.
