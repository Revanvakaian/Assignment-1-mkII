<B>Discussion:</b>
<p>
The results from the completed personality tests to me mean a great deal, during the completion of these tests I strived to answer the best I could being honest to a fault. My reasoning behind this is that I believe knowing more about yourself and about how you work and function as an individual is when you can strive to improve yourself and know your limitations. Knowing your own limitations is key, I believe that admitting your inability to do something is a remarkable and sadly rare trait in society today. If more people worked on improving themselves the world may be very different.
<p>
My results overall were geared towards a very logical, visual and neuroticism. My personal interpretation of these results means that I am a very methodical, graphic and pessimistic person. Meaning that within a group setting I may find myself being overly critical of other people’s work until seeing the full result before me. Being in a group in general is not my preferred method of completing tasks and goals but I understand it is fact of life that people will be required to work together in a multitude of settings. 
<p>
In forming a team I feel I would -based on these results- find myself owning up to any mistakes I make within a group setting, and also trying to plan out the tasks and end goals of an objective while also trying to provide visual results and feedback to my team. I would also be completely open to people within the team of my expectations, limitations and hope that everyone comes together to achieve the result.
